Shibboleth Liferay Extension
by Chris Jurado, Johns Hopkins University
Designed for Liferay Version 6

This is a Liferay Extension project that adds a Shibboleth Auto-login module to Liferay to authenticate through the Shibboleth Web SSO provider.

Note:  This Extension is NOT a standalone project.  In order for it to work, you MUST also install the Shibboleth-Authentication-Hook plugin.

To install:

First, build this project:

-Copy the folder into your local liferay SDK environment in the ext folder.
-Run the enclosed ant build script (ant deploy)
-If your local environment is configured to automatically copy the resulting .war file into your Liferay Deploy folder, it will install automatically for you from there.  Otherwise you can manually copy the .war file into your Liferay deploy folder
-OR-
Upload the file through the Liferay GUI plugins installation screen.

Add the following lines to your portal-ext.properties file:

#Shibboleth Auto Login Setup
auto.login.hooks=com.liferay.portal.security.auth.ShibbolethAutoLogin, com.liferay.portal.security.auth.RememberMeAutoLogin
auth.pipeline.enable.liferay.check=false

Restart Liferay

Next, download the Shibboleth-Liferay-Hook and follow the installation instructions.

*NOTE*********************************************

And this is VERY important.

The module is built assuming your Shibboleth Identity Provider is sending you the credentials using HTTP Attributes.  This isn't always the case.  Sometimes it's sent as HTTP Headers, so be sure you know how your metadata is coming and be prepared to modify the source code accordingly!
